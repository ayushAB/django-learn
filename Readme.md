  - Create a enviroments directory and on mac if you have a project in a directory called `my-project` you can set up virtualenv for that project by running: ------ `virtualenv venv`
  - Create an environment by running the following command: ------- `python3 -m venv my_env`
  - Activate the enviroment by following command: ------- `source my_env/bin/activate` (Note: running this will make your enviroment name to appear in the command promp called `my_env`)
